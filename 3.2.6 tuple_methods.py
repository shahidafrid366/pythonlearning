! Tuple Methods
* Python has two built-in methods that you can use on tuples.

Method	    Description
count()	    Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
index()	    Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found


? Examples:
? 1. Count method is used to print the number of occurences in a tuple
a = ("apple", "banana", "carrot", "apple")
b = a.count("apple")
print(b)

? 2. index method is used to print the value at a specified index from a tuple.
? For example, here this print the position of 6 from the tuple which is 3
a = (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 5)
b = a.index(6)
print(b)
