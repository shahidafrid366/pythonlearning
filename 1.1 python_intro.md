<h1>What is Python?</h1>
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:
* web development (server-side),
* software development,
* mathematics,
* system scripting.


<h3>What can Python do?</h3>

* Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
* Python can be used alongside software to create workflows. 
* Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
* Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
* Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.


<h3>Why Python?</h3>

* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.


<h3>Good to know</h3>

* The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial.
* In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated
* Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.


<h3>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h3>

* Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
