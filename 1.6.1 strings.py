! Strings
Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes or in single quotes.

len() determines the length of string

indexing allows to access individual characters
indexing starts with 0 or either -1 both are supported
Negative indices represent the last character from the string & positive indicates first character of string


! Slicing:
Extracting the substring from a string
Syntax:- string[start:end:step]
    start - start of the substring
    end - end of the substring
    step - the step at which the substring starts [default is]


! Concatenation & Repetition:
Concatenation - joining the strings with + operator
Repetition  - repeating the strings with * operator
string methods for manipulation
Case change: upper(), lower()
Character replacement: replace()

# ! ---  Indexing Examples  ---
greeting = "Hello, World"
name = "shahid_afrid"

print(greeting[0:5])  # Output: Hello
print(greeting[1:5])  # Output: ello
print(
    greeting[-1:5]
)  # Output: <blank line> because python slicing works only from left to right
print(
    greeting[-1:-5]
)  # Output: <blank line> because start index is -1 (-d) & end index is -5 (W).
# Since no step is provided, it defaults to +1, i.e., left to right

#! Important Rule: If start index is after end index (when using positive step), the result is an empty string.
print(
    greeting[-1:-5:-3]
)  # Output: do - because indexing starts from -1 so it prints d, index ends
# at -5(W) W won't be printed, -3 this is step it tells that it has to
# move three steps from current positing and print that letter so d is printed
print(
    greeting[1:5:3]
)  # Output: eo - because for positive indexing, index starts from 0 so eo is printed
print(greeting[-1])  # Output: d
print(
    greeting[::2]
)  # Output: hlo ol - since there is no start and end index so it will print
# all the letters from that variable with 2 step
print(greeting[::-2])  # Output: drW,le - this will print from last character

print(name[0:5])  # Output: shahi
print(name[1:5])  # Output: hahi
print(
    name[-1:5]
)  # Output: <blank line> because python slicing works only from left to right
print(
    name[-1:-5]
)  # Output: <blank line> because start index is -1 (-d) & end index is -5 (a).
# Since no step is provided, it defaults to +1, i.e., left to right
print(
    name[-1:-5:-3]
)  # Output: df because indexing starts from -1 so it prints d, index ends
# at -5(a) W won't be printed, -3 this is step it tells that it has to
# move three steps from current positing and print that letter so f is printed
print(
    name[1:5:3]
)  # Output: hi : because for positive indexing, index starts from 0 so hi is printed
print(name[-1])  # Output: d
print(name[::2])  # Output: sai_fi
print(name[::-2])  # Output: dradhh


# ! ---  Concatenation & Repetition Examples ---
greeting = "Hello, World"
name = "shahid_afrid"

print(greeting + "Python")  # Output: Hello, WorldPython

message = greeting + " " + "Python"
print(message)  # Output: Hello World Python


message = greeting, "Python"
print(message)  # Output: ("Hello, World", "Python")
# Here you're using a comma (,) between two items,
# which does not concatenate them as strings. Instead, the comma creates
# a tuple, a data structure in Python that holds multiple items.
# Tuples are used to group values together, but they donâ€™t combine them into a single string.
# The comma creates a tuple of two elements:
# The first element: "Hello, World"
# The second element: "Python" So Output is: ("Hello, World", "Python)

# ! --- Repetition with *  ---
name_repeat = name * 3
print(name_repeat)  # Output: shahid_afridshahid_afridshahid_afrid

# Using string methods
name = "shahid_afrid"

print(name.lower())  # Output: shahid_afrid
print(name.upper())  # Output: SHAHID_AFRID
print(name.title())  # Output: Shahid_Afrid
print(name.capitalize())  # Output: Shahid_afrid - First letter is capital
print(
    name.replace("d", "dd")
)  # Output: shahid_afridd it will replace new characters with old one's

print(name.center(17, "*"))  # Output: ***shahid_afrid**
# center() this method is used to center the content
# the value you are passing should be greater than the string character.
# You can pass any padding characters like *, -, =, /, _, &, ^, %, #,@ etc

print(
    name.casefold()
)  # convert a string to lowercase, but with a stronger emphasis on case
# normalization than lower(). It's especially useful for case-insensitive
# string comparisons, particularly when dealing with text in different
# languages that might have special cases or accented characters

## Coding Exercise
# Task 1: Create string variables
greeting = "Hello, World!"
name = "Alice"

# Task 2: Print the length of the greeting string
# Your code here
print(len(greeting))

# Task 3: Use indexing to print specific characters
# Your code here
print(greeting[0])
print(greeting[2])
print(name[-1])

# Task 4: Use slicing to print parts of strings
# Your code here
print(greeting[:5])
print(name[2:4:1])

# Task 5: Print the greeting string in reverse
# Your code here
print(greeting[::-1])

# Task 6: Perform string concatenation
# Create full_name without a space and full_name_space with a space
# Your code here
full_name = name + "Wonderland"
print(full_name)
full_name_space = name + " " + "Wonderland"
print(full_name_space)

# Task 7: Use string repetition
# Your code here
repetition = name
repetition *= 3
print(repetition)

# Task 8: Use string methods
# Your code here
print(greeting.upper())
print(name.lower())
print(name.replace("l", "x"))
